# Video Subtitle Generator Using Python

This project is a Python-based tool designed to extract audio from video files, transcribe the audio into text, and generate subtitles with precise synchronization. By utilizing **Whisper**, an advanced speech-to-text model by OpenAI, the application ensures high accuracy in transcription across multiple languages and accents.

## Features

- **Audio Extraction**: Seamlessly extract audio from video files in formats like MP4, MKV, AVI, etc.
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Convert spoken words into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
- **Accurate Subtitle Generation**: Produce properly synchronized subtitles in SRT format for use with any video player.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Generate subtitles in various languages supported by Whisper.
- **User-Friendly Workflow**: Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) for quick and efficient subtitle generation.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for non-technical users.
- Support for additional subtitle formats (e.g., VTT).
- Real-time transcription and subtitle generation.
